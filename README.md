# DBConvert Streams: Database Conversion and Real-time Replication

Welcome to DBConvert Streams! This repository provides examples, configuration files, and Docker files for utilizing DBConvert Streams in various scenarios. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue.

## What is DBConvert Streams?

[DBConvert Streams (DBS)](https://stream.dbconvert.com/guide/introduction) is a cutting-edge distributed platform designed for heterogeneous database conversion and real-time data replication. It simplifies the process of transferring data between on-premises or cloud databases, including relational databases and data warehouses. DBConvert Streams operates in two modes:

### Modes of Data Transfer:

1. **Conversion Mode:**
   Quickly transfer data between on-premises or cloud databases, whether they are relational or data warehouses.

2. **CDC (Change Data Capture) Mode:**
   Stream changes from the source to the target database using [change data capture](https://dbconvert.com/blog/change-data-capture-cdc-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) technology. DBConvert Streams keeps track of the source database, capturing all `Insert,` `Update,` and `Delete` row-level changes, allowing your applications to respond to events with minimal latency.


## Blazing Speed

> DBConvert Streams, the speedster of database migration tools, raced through the latest performance tests with finesse. Picture this: 50 million records, around 150 GB of data, zooming from MySQL to Postgres in just over 20 minutes. And here's the cherry on top—speeds reaching up to 120 Mb per second. Brace yourself for unparalleled efficiency in your database migration and replication processes!
